{"name":"Byke","tagline":"A low-cost automatic transmission system for a standard bicycle. Second place at HackPrinceton Fall 2014.","body":"# Overview\r\nManually changing gears while riding a bicycle is fine, but so outdated!  We built an Arduino-based transmission system that changes bicycle sprockets to maintain a steady pedaling cadence. To accomplish this, we measured rear wheel speed using hall-effect encoders and converted this value to a pedal cadence using pre-determined gear ratios.  We also directly measured pedaling cadence to enforce accuracy and determine if the rider was pedaling fast enough for gear switching to work. If pedaling cadence was different from the target cadence, the system would automatically shift accordingly. Shifting gears was accomplished by connecting the shift cable to a high-torque servo and carefully sending PWM values to tighten or loosen the cable. We built Byke in 48 hours for HackPrinceton Fall 2014 and ended up winning second place. \r\n\r\nHere is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvb7XR2iPEc) of Byke in action!\r\n\r\n# People\r\nAnkush Gola, Joseph Bolling, Ted Brundage\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
